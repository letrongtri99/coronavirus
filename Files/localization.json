      "Gene_description": "ANGIOTENSIN I-CONVERTING ENZYME 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, and intestines that lowers blood pressure by converting angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into angiotensin (1-7) (a vasodilator).  ACE2 also serves as the site of cell entry for some coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  The spike protein of the virus attaches to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 and cleavage of the spike protein by a host protease (TMPRSS2) triggers subsequent internalization of the virus into the cell for further replication and infection.  Variants in ACE2 can be detrimental to virus infection by either affecting the binding of the virus particle to ACE2, the accessibility of the host protease to the spike cleavage site of the virus, or the ability to be internalized.",

      "CATEGORY DESCRIPTION": "Viruses infect cells by hijacking your cellular machinery for its own use.  This includes the virus binding to a naturally occurring receptor on your cell surfaces, internalizing the virus and providing an environment to reproduce its genome as well as all of its viral components. New viruses are assembled then secreted from the cell for subsequent amplification and spread of infection.  There are several ways that virus infection can be disrupted and we have identified 5 genes and a number of variants that may impact coronavirus replication.  The most studied gene impacting coronavirus infection is the ACE2 gene which is the cellular receptor for these viruses including SARS CoV-2.  We have analyzed you for 14 different variants within the ACE2 gene some of which reduce infectivity by the virus and others that promote or correlate with infectivity or infected individuals.  The ANPEP gene has also been identified as another potential receptor to the virus. "

The main purpose of the innate immune responses is to immediately prevent the spread and movement of foreign pathogens throughout the body before they can start an infection.  These defenses can be physical, chemical or cellular.  Your skin, epithelial cells, and mucus are examples of the physical barrier between the inside of the body and the outside world and protect us from infections.  There are several different kinds of proteins that serve as chemical defenses.  These include the intracellular enzymes and proteins that may disrupt viral replication and secretion.  There are a number of circulating molecules in that recognize conserved features of pathogens that are not normally present in our bodies. Upon binding to the pathogen-specific features can trigger a cascade of responses such as complement activation which disrupts the membrane or viral coat of the microorganism or attract immune cells to a specific location for ingestion and destruction and , or to produce an inflammatory response to trigger the adaptive immune response, the second line of defense which is responsible for a more targeted attack on the pathogen including recruitment of cells with killing activity and production of specific antibodies."

It has been suggested that high levels of RANTES may intensify lung inflammation, leading to severe clinical outcome among SARS patients and increase the risk of secondary infections that may contribute to the observed death rate.  High levels of CCL5 have also been shown to cause acute renal failure and liver toxicity which could also contribute to the increased death rate.  In a recent COVID-19 study, 10 critically ill patients had markedly elevated CCL5 levels compared to both healthy controls and mild or moderate COVID-19 patients.

        "ACE2":
        "ANGIOTENSIN I-CONVERTING ENZYME 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, and intestines that lowers blood pressure by converting angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into angiotensin (1-7) (a vasodilator).  ACE2 also serves as the site of cell entry for some coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  The spike protein of the virus attaches to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 and cleavage of the spike protein by a host protease (TMPRSS2) triggers subsequent internalization of the virus into the cell for further replication and infection.  Variants in ACE2 can be detrimental to virus infection by either affecting the binding of the virus particle to ACE2, the accessibility of the host protease to the spike cleavage site of the virus, or the ability to be internalized."

      {
        "ANPEP": "Alanyl aminopeptidase, or aminopeptidase N is also a potent angiogenic regulator which also plays a role in the final digestion of peptides generated from hydrolysis of proteins by gastric and pancreatic proteases and has been implicated in acting as a receptor to some coronaviruses.  However, no link to SARS-CoV-2 has been made to date and the mechanism for virus entry is not known."
      },
      {
        "OAS1": "2-PRIME,5-PRIME-OLIGOADENYLATE SYNTHETASE 1 is a key antiviral enzyme that is induced by interferons.  OAS restricts viral infection by binding to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) which triggers subsequent binding and activation of RNase L resulting in the degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of viral replication.  Variants in OAS have been shown limit HCV virus infection and are also associated with protection from persistent SARS CoV infection."
      },
      {
        "MX1": "MX1 gene encodes Myxovirus resistance A (MxA) which is a GTPase induced by interferon α and β (IFN-α, IFN-β) that can inhibit viral replication.  MxA inhibits a broad spectrum of viruses and although the precise molecular mechanism of virus inhibition is not known, it likely involves assembly of a multimeric structure that binds to the virus during transcription and replication."
      },
      {
        "MBL2": "Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) protein 2 is a serum protein that is part of the acute-phase response to viral and bacterial infections.  MBL2 contains carbohydrate binding sites which specifically match up to mannose and fucose residues in bacterial cell walls and viral particles which upon binding triggers inflammatory responses to destroy the virus or bacteria.   The amounts of MBL in human plasma are genetically determined Variant alleles causing low plasma concentrations of functional MBL have been shown to be associated in both children and adults with an increased risk of developing infections. Genetic variants have been associated with lower than normal levels of serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL) levels are associated with an increased susceptibility to SARS."

      {
        "AHGS": "Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG) is also known as fetuin-A and encodes a multifunctional phosphorylated extracellular calcium-regulatory glycoprotein that is an acute phase protein that is negatively regulated during infection or other inflammatory illness.  AHSG levels decrease in response to several proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-γ.  Patients with other inflammatory diseases such as pancreatitis, chronic kidney diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis display decreased levels of AHSG.  AHSG deficiency is also associated with chronic kidney disease and contributes to vascular complications  In these inflammatory diseased patients, circulating AHSG levels negatively correlated with levels of cytokines (such as IL-6), and associated with increased mortality rates. 
      In vitro experiments suggest that SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein can associate with AHSG thereby neutralizing the pro-inflammatory effect of the SARS nucleocapsid protein since AHSG is so abundant in the serum (0.2–0.55 mg/ml).
      One specific genotype affects the transcriptional activity of the AHSG promoter which leads to a higher AHSG serum concentrations and has been associated with protection against SARS development while other genotypes in this region have been associated with susceptibility to SARS.    
      Another polymorphism of AHSG located within the coding region is associated with an increased susceptibility of developing clinically apparent SARS but the mechanism by which susceptibility is increased is unknown."},
      {
          "CD14": "CD14 is also known as the monocyte differentiation antigen which detects bacteria in the body by binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the bacterial cell surface and results in cellular activation and production of proinflammatory mediators and protection from infection.  Elevated levels of CD14 has been implicated in sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and other acute inflammatory responses.
      A polymorphism in CD14 can decrease CD14 levels and the inflammatory response following LPS stimulation.  This polymorphism is also associated with the severity of SARS-CoV infection where patients homozygous for the polymorphism were submitted to the Intensive Care Unit suggesting that reduced CD14 levels may contribute to have reduced antiviral activity and thus experience enhanced viral toxicity, resulting in a more severe form of SARS-CoV infection, but the exact mechanism of CD14 in response to viruses is not clear."},
      {
            "IFNG": "Interferon-gamma (IFN-G) is a cytokine critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumor control.  The importance of IFN-G in the immune system stems in part from its ability to inhibit viral replication directly, but most importantly derives from its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. IFN-G is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector T cells once antigen-specific immunity develops.  Aberrant IFN-G expression is associated with a number of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
      IFN-G may be involved in SARS pathogenesis and variants in the IFN-G gene impact the regulation of its gene expression where low IFN-G production may impair the anti-viral response against SARS-CoV, rendering these individuals more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection."},
      {
              "CCL2": "CCL-2/ Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1) is a chemokine that plays a role in innate immunity by recruiting monocytes, macrophages and T-lymphocyte in acute inflammatory responses. Overexpression of MCP1 is one of the most prominent chemokines upregulated in SARS-CoV infected lung epithelial cells and is overexpressed in the plasma of SARS patients.    
      A polymorphism in CCL-2 is located adjacent to a key promoter element and produces elevated MCP1.  This polymorphism has been reported to be associated with increased susceptibility or severity of diseases such as asthma, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis.  Carriers of this variant may explain the observed elevated CCL2 levels and the correlation with more advanced disease severity of SARS patients."},
      {
                "IL4": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4)is a cytokine that regulates humoral and adaptive immunity by stimulating the growth and differentiation of T and B cells, processes which are critical to developing an immune response to virus infection. However, overproduction of IL-4 is associated with development of immune disorders, particularly allergies and some autoimmune diseases including those manifested with respiratory inflammation.  
      A variant has been identified in the regulatory region of IL-4 that may result in overexpression of IL-4.  This variant has also been associated with respiratory infections for tuberculosis, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia and SARS-Coronavirus."},
      {
                  "CCL5": "CCL5/RANTES (Regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) is a chemokine that recruits immune cells to inflammatory site and is involved in many viral infections.  SARS-CoV-infected airway epithelial cells and macrophages express high levels of CCL5 which can amplify inflammatory responses toward immunopathology.
      A polymorphism in CCL5 is located at the NF-κB binding site which leads to elevated promoter activity and CCL5 expression in in CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and monocytes/macrophages.  In a 2005 study of 495 SARS-CoV patients and 578 ethnically matched healthy controls where this polymorphism has been associated with not only increased susceptibility to SARS but also increased risk of death. A high level of CCL5 may predispose individuals to developing SARS and an increased risk of death. It has been suggested that high levels of RANTES may intensify lung inflammation, leading to severe clinical outcome among SARS patients and increase the risk of secondary infections that may contribute to the observed death rate.  High levels of CCL5 have also been shown to cause acute renal failure and liver toxicity which could also contribute to the increased death rate.  In a recent COVID-19 study,
                  10 critically ill patients had markedly elevated CCL5 levels compared to both healthy controls and mild or moderate COVID-19 patients.  These patients were treated with leronlimab which blocks CCR5, the receptor for CCL5, which reduced inflammation, restored T-cell lymphocytopenia and reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels.  This further suggests the potential for severe clinical outcomes for elevated CCL5 levels."},
      {
                    "FCGR2A": "FCGR2A is expressed on a variety of immune cells and binds to the Fc regions of immunoglobulins and clears bacteria and viruses from circulation once they are recognized by antibodies.  FCGR2A is the receptor for the Fc portion of IgG IIA and an important mediator of humoral immune response regulating both the cellular response to infections as well as the uptake of immune complexes.  This clearance also triggers cytokine stimulation.   
      Variants of FCGR2A have been associated with susceptibility to inflammatory and infectious diseases.  This includes systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, and ulcerative colitis as malaria infection and increased risks of severe respiratory tract infections from SARS Coronavirus."},
      {
                      "CYP4F3": "CYTOCHROME P450, FAMILY 4, SUBFAMILY F, POLYPEPTIDE 3 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. CYP4F3 catalyzes the omega-hydroxylation of the potent inflammatory factor leukotriene B4. (LTB4) thereby inactivating it.  Removal of excess LTB4 important for the prevention of immunologic damage.
      In vitro studies suggested that CYP4F3 may interact with the SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein and impact the pulmonary inflammation associated with SARS CoV infection.   A variant of CYP4F3 was shown to be associated with an increased susceptibility to SARS, but was not confirmed in other populations.  The influence of this CYP4F3 on SARS susceptibility is unclear."}

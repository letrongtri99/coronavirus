                Your results are also organized by disease group. Breakthrough Genomics’ ENLITER™ software uses whole genome sequencing to give you insights <br> for many health conditions. It can detect genetic variants that may predispose you to develop certain disorders in any of the disease categories listed <br> below. It is important to understand that identifying a variant associated with one or more of these disorders does not mean that you will necessarily <br>
                develop that disorder. Likewise, if we do not identify a variant, this does not eliminate the possibility that you may develop a condition included in <br> these disease groups. We encourage you to read the short descriptions below.

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-detail">Cancer is a common disease. One in three Americans will develop cancer in their lifetime, usually
                        due to environmental exposures, behavior and lifestyle choices. Some individuals are born with
                        variants in genes that may predispose
                        them to develop certain types of cancer in their lifetime. Knowing if you are at an increased
                        risk for certain cancer types will allow you and your physician to tailor monitoring, discuss
                        prevention options, and influence your
                        lifestyle choices.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-detail">Blood clotting is also known as coagulation, a part of the wound healing process. Some genetic
                        variants may predispose individuals to developing blood clots more often, while other variants
                        may result in reduced clotting ability (sometimes
                        called bleeding disorders). Knowing if you are at increased risk for a clotting disorder can
                        help you and your physician to tailor your surveillance. It may also influence your lifestyle
                        choices and help you to reduce your risk
                        for bleeds or clots.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-detail">Being a carrier means that you have a variant in one copy of a gene associated with a recessive
                        disease. This means that you have one 'non-working' copy of the gene, along with one 'working'
                        copy. Recessive disorders require an individual
                        to have two variants in order to develop the disease, therefore you 'carry' a variant but you
                        are not at risk to have this disease yourself. However, you may be at risk to have children
                        affected with this disease, if your reproductive
                        partner is also a carrier for the same condition. It is important to discuss these results with
                        a genetic counselor or other qualified healthcare professional for family planning purposes. In
                        some recessive conditions, carriers
                        may express mild symptoms. Please see the detailed report for specific information about your
                        findings. The conditions and genes included in our carrier screening section of the test were
                        selected based on guidelines from the American
                        College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Medical Genetics
                        and Genomics (ACMG).

                        Traits pertain to characteristics that are heavily influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Some of these characteristics are modifiable with lifestyle changes, such as exercise, diet, and nutrition – while some are quirky predispositions. Because of the complexity of these traits, you may find that some interpretations ring true, whereas others may not. You may carry variants with additive effects, or even opposing effects. An example of the latter is one variant that predisposes you to straight hair and one that predisposes you to curly hair. Information published on individual variants often do not take into account the effects of variants in various combinations, but only their independent effects. This test includes the following lifestyle trait categories.

                        Is your family history largely free of heart disease? This might be partly due to genetic variants you carry. The cardiovascular (circulatory) system includes your heart and blood vessels. The heart pumps blood through the blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries) to deliver oxygen throughout the body, as well as to remove wastes from tissues. Cardiovascular health depends to a great degree on many factors aside from the heart and blood vessels, including blood composition.

                        Think about puberty, PMS, or pregnancy—hormones have a way of wreaking havoc. But these distressing roller coaster experiences underscore the critical importance of normal hormonal functions in regulating both body and mind. Our bodies use hormones to send signals or messages to distant cells and organs, to regulate many important biological processes. Hormones influence physical processes such as metabolism, development, and reproduction, and they can also profoundly influence our moods, feelings, and thoughts. The genetic variations governing some of our hormonal systems should provide insight into certain predispositions in these traits.

                        Are you the one in your family who always catches that bug? The immune system is vastly complex and actually consists of two functionally different but critically important systems: the innate immune system and the acquired immune system. Our innate immune system provides genetic defenses against all pathogenic invaders, while the acquired immune system relies on previous exposures and cellular “memories” of those exposures. Genetic variants determine many important differences between individual’s immune systems.

                        Ever wonder if you have a genetic predisposition for extreme longevity? Longevity record holders are renowned for their amazing youthfulness—dancing, playing golf, riding bicycles, and going out for nights on the town—even beyond age 100! Scientific studies of these people suggest that both genetic and environmental factors (like diet) are critical for slow and healthy aging. Matching the right environmental factors to genetic factors is probably key, and in just the past few years science has discovered some of the most critical factors for promoting longevity.

                        Is losing or gaining weight easy for you? Has this changed as you’ve grown older? Your current metabolism and your genes both play large roles in weight maintenance and changes you’ll experience over time. Some people convert their meals into energy more efficiently or faster than others. How you eat and exercise can affect your metabolism, and your genetic makeup makes important contributions to how responsive you are to exercise. These results will give you insight into your metabolic predispositions and may help you adjust certain aspects of your lifestyle.

Breakthrough Genomics’ test examines genes and variants associated with nutritional needs and biological responses to diet, which could help you identify discrepancies between your current diet and your daily nutritional needs.

                        When you look in the mirror, what you see—from height, hair, and skin tones to eye color—is greatly determined by your genes. Think of identical twins and their amazing similarities. Identical genomes make twins as incredibly identical as they are. Therefore, your genetic makeup greatly influences the physical attributes you are born with, but doesn’t restrict you from deciding the appearance that best fits your personality.

                        Sleep is a biological imperative critical to the maintenance of mental and physical health. It is a state of lessened consciousness and decreased physical activity during which the organism slows down and repairs itself. Healthy sleep comprises many dimensions, including adequate duration, good quality, appropriate timing, and the absence of sleep disorders and all these factors have a genetic etiology. Information published on individual variants often do not consider the effects of variants in various combinations, but only their independent effects. This test includes the following lifestyle trait categories.

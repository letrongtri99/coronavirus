            ANGIOTENSIN I-CONVERTING ENZYME 2 is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, and intestines that lowers blood pressure by converting angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into angiotensin (1-7) (a vasodilator).  ACE2 also serves as the site of cell entry for some coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  The spike protein of the virus attaches to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 and cleavage of the spike protein by a host protease (TMPRSS2) triggers subsequent internalization of the virus into the cell for further replication and infection.  Variants in ACE2 can be detrimental to virus infection by either affecting the binding of the virus particle to ACE2, the accessibility of the host protease to the spike cleavage site of the virus, or the ability to be internalized.
            <br><br>
            The ACE2 gene is located on the X-chromosome, so males will only have one copy of this gene while female will have two copies.  An infection resistant variant of ACE2 in a male will be protective of virus infection while a female who carries a resistant variant will only be partially protective of the virus unless she happens to possess another copy of the resistant variant on her other X chromosome.

            You carry the M82T gene variant which alters a CRITICAL RESIDUE IN ACE2 CRUCIAL FOR VIRAL BINDING.  Using in vitro mutational analysis M82 was found to be a critical amino acid residue of ACE2 reported for its interaction with spike proteins of SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV-2.  Carrying this variant should prevent binding and infection by the coronavirus making you resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.  M82T was also identified a rare variant mostly found in European non-Finnish and African populations.<br><br>
            Currently evidence on this variant are based only on in vitro assays and structural prediction models. However, further clinical studies and other relevant data may help in ascertaining the role (if any) of this variant in the coronavirus binding and infection in humans.
